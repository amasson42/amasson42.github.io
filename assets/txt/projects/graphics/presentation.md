Where the real work begins.

To put this project short: Let's use OpenGL.

Every graphicals projects I worked on so far where more about mathematics than technology. As I already said, I love mathematics, so I actually enjoyed it.
But can I make a video games with an engine that needs more than 3 seconds to render a textured sphere ? Well yes I could maybe think about creating a Point&Click game or another kind that doesn't require a fluid 60fps gameplay and gives you a 5 minutes loading screen before showing a static image. But for unknown reasons I'm not really interested in that idea and that's why I stepped into the world of **GPUs** !

This project started from a school project that required us to parse and render 3D [obj files](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) using OpenGL and the programming language we wanted.

To choose the language, as someone who often praise the idea of trying new things to not live on your assets and expand your knowledge base, I have chosen C++ so I could... totally stay in my comfort zone ! But also because it seems to be the most logical choice while developing video games.
> I did not know Rust back then but if I had to restart it all, I would totally use it with Vulkan now.

I started this project by following [a tutorial on OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).
But as I continued to learn about GPU, shaders, game engines and different rendering solutions, I tried to put everything in the same project and make all of those compatible between each other.
All rendering methods are using the same protocol to write in an image buffer using the same drawing behavior.
Thatâ€™s how I now have my own graphical engine that can handle some of the big game engine functionalities like drawing ~~models of 3D waif~~ 3D meshes, animating particle systems, lighting a scene, skeletal animation...

Render a triangle

Render multiple triangles

Render meshes composed of set of triangles

Transform matrices system hierarchy that can organise meshes in groups

Instanciated meshes

Assimp asset importing (image and scenes)

Particle system with OpenCL interoperability

Skeletal meshe animations

Voxel rendering with geometry shaders

Skybox
