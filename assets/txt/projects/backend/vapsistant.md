I was the DevOps of a company, the guy who write Jenkins pipelines and organize the processes. I liked this tool and all the things we could do with it. I also love to see all the plugins we could make with it... Until I tried to make one and was faced to use Java ! I'm not totally against the idea of learning it. But I saw an opportunity to practice the framework that I was just learning: Vapor. Instead of creating a plugin for the Jenkins server, I made an api that communicate with my server using JenkinsCLI and that display shortcut actions that my coworkers could simply clic on to get things done.
