The goal of this project was to get familiar with the usage of an API (a relatively important concept when doing front-end I guess). And I tought it was a nice oportunity to use most of the thing we often have to use when developing an App !

The usage of the app is quite simple. We have to type the login of a student in a search bar and the application will call the school API for all informations it can find and then render it all

So here is a list of everything that app is using :
- navigation controller (and segue)
- auto layout (of course)
- many basic views (UITextField, UILabel, UIActivityIndicator, UIButton, UIImageView, UIStackView, UISegmentedControl, UIProgressView, UIVisualEffectView)
- advanced view (UITableView, UICollectionView)
- custom view (a view that is drawn using UIBezierPath)
- CocoaPods (some svg viewer)
