You know what a game of tarot is ?
When we play it, we always need to ask someone to keep track of scores.
There is always some really complicated calculs in place like additions and even worst, substractions !
That's a lot for a simple human brain and it's prone to error. And when that happen, we have to re count everything like trump did after the elections.
That's a lot of time we don't want to waste when we could be playing tarot instead.

This project is a solution to a problem no one have !
Its purpose is to calculate the score of player from the result of a game input. The real goal of the project is to have fun with SwiftUI to create some animated user interface, implement a MVVM solution, use storage solution and discover the limit of developing on the iPad Playgrounds !

After a short usage a multiple parties, I upgraded this app to not only track scores at tarot, but also at every other game we usually play.
