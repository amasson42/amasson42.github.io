My experience with iOS started with Objective-C, when we still had to retain and release our memory (the time when I was free to imagine my own retarded life-cycles instead of using thoses complicated "weak" and "strong" keywords !).

I made a lot of little projects during my learning of the different modules of Cocoa on both macOS and iOS. I won't list all of them but will instead show you the big ones that are actually interesting.
