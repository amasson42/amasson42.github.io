★☆☆☆☆ Minimal. I know where to use it and what I can expect to do with this technology. But I will have to google even the most basic things.
★★☆☆☆ Fair. I can geet things done but I will probably leave technical debts behind me.
★★★☆☆ Good. I did use it multiple times but I don't think I have the best practices with it yet.
★★★★☆ Confident. I can say with confidence that I can start or join any project using this and be helpfull or even taking the lead.
★★★★★ Expert. (Self-proclamed). I am (or have been) passionated with this and have used it as much as I could. I did dig into all possible way of using it and I continue to learn anything I can about this technology.
