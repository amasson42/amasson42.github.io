Hi, my name is Arthur Masson and I'm passionate about creating random automatized things. I've always loved mathematics, smart thinking and reliable logic but we all know those three things are kind of the same thing !

I started to love programming the first time I created a custom map in warcraft3 and never really stopped learning new things since then.

Aside from that, I spend a lot of my time playing video games... So much that if I had not spent this potentially productive time playing but instead creating my own game then I would have made ~~a game~~ the best game of all time that would have wasted the social life of an entire generation instead of just mine ! So I'm glad I'm not that kind of monster and I contain myself from doing so by playing more games O:)

I started (real) programming in C when I was in high school and I've always liked it. I discovered later that other languages existed as well and my love for programming got a new turn... Such a life-changing event the day I found out about C++ ! That thing I was doing with my uniformized structures and function and those code templates I had to copy and paste for each one of my different types was already a thing ! It was called Object Oriented Programming... Awesome !... I'm less ignorant now !

Therefore, C++ stayed my favorite language for a long time. The main reason was that I have become familiar with its syntax but also because it was the best language to create video games ! Wich was and probably will stay one of my ambitions as a main or side project.

I then wanted to create graphical programs (because for some reason, playing Pacman on the command line was getting boring) so as an eternal Mac user, I had to leave my new favorite language for another one to use all of those amazing graphical frameworks designed by Apple: The language Objective-C (ever heard about that ?) I never really liked it but had to use it so I did. And of course, as I was still in high school back then, no one understood what I was doing so no one would tell me that there were other technologies than native frameworks. I could use some things like SDL or Qt to stay in C++ ! So I did learn all about this Cocoa framework and used it to create random graphical programs and all those great things we make with interfaces (bye bye command line... For now :D). And that's how I got used to working in the Apple ecosystem and have been slowly slipping from desktop development to mobile iOS development. It was only a matter of framework and nothing else !

Once I finished high school, I got accepted into a special school called "42 Born to code". (I call it special because it's a school with a really different way of teaching students than traditional schools that I won't explain here.) It's in this school that I finally met my own breed: ~~Nerds~~ Others passionated coders.
I like working in a group, not only for social interactions but also because when I'm alone on a project, I tend to let it drown after a day of not working on it or just with the random idea of another ~~useless~~ really important project.

One day Apple created its own new and modern language called Swift. That gave a new meaning to my life ! Two weeks of using Swift made me fall in love with this perfectly designed language ! I'm not an addicted of mobile plateforms... As a matter of fact, I hate playing on those... But games aren't the only thing we do on our phones (I think). So for the only reason that I love the Apple ecosystem, I've spent a lot of time creating apps for iPhone and Mac ! When I say "apps", I mean "unfinished project at proof of concept state to test one feature of a framework or implement an idea".

During my studies, I had to find a part-time job but instead, I joined a startup on a full-time job. I started there as an iOS developer developing two apps that they were creating. Once those two were finished, my iOS skills were no longer required and I tried to join the front-end team by learning some basic web development with Symfony, then quickly switched to discover the world of DevOps. I finally got rid of my impostor syndrome from not knowing Docker and had some fun creating scripts that do every repetitive task that my coworkers were doing manually like bundling their NodeJs app, sending it on the production machine and installing it... Manually ! My new purpose as the DevOps were to trigger builds from commits that would create containers from their source code, create the platform to deploy the code from all microservices together in a clustered environment and run our tests against the services and Apis. I also learned how to create a backend service, containerize it and deploy them with Docker swarm or Kubernetes but I left the startup before being able to use those newly developed talents.

After leaving I wanted to try the life of freelance. Being able to choose where, when and how I work. And mostly, to face one of my worst fears... Papers administration and adult stuffs !
