    <h2>Metal</h2>
    <p>After going this far with openGL and being much more familiar with usage of GPU, shaders and mathematics for video games rendering, I wanted to see how to use Metal, another 3D framework, but developed by Apple exlusively for their own hardware (kind
        of like everything Apple does). So I implemented most of the features I had from GLScene into Metal. </p>

    <h1>Backend stuff</h1>
    <p>I did backend, look</p>
    <h2>Vapor-playground</h2>
    <h2>Vapsistant</h2>
    <p>I was the DevOps of a company, the guy who write Jenkins pipelines and organize the processes. I liked this tool and all the things we could do with it. I also love to see all the plugins we could make with it... Until I tried to make one and was
        faced to use Java ! I'm not totally against the idea of learning it. But I saw an opportunity to practice the framework that I was just learning: Vapor. Instead of creating a plugin for the Jenkins server, I made an api that communicate with my
        server using JenkinsCLI and that display shortcut actions that my coworkers could simply clic on to get things done.

    <h2>Todogo</h2>
    <p>I had no purpose for this project exept learning go and the gin framework. It's a todo app that use a database</p>
